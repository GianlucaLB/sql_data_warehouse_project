# 🧱 SQL Data Warehouse Project

A complete end-to-end data warehouse built in SQL Server, covering the full data lifecycle from raw ingestion (ETL) to analytics-ready models.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Design a modern data warehouse using the Medallion architecture (Bronze, Silver, Gold layers).
- Build ETL pipelines to clean, transform, and integrate data from multiple sources.
- Model the data into a star schema for efficient analytical queries.
- Deliver SQL-based insights into sales performance and customer behavior.

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

The project follows a layered approach:

- **Bronze Layer** – Raw data imported from ERP and CRM CSV files.  
- **Silver Layer** – Cleaned and standardized data prepared for modeling.  
- **Gold Layer** – Business-ready analytical model (Fact and Dimension tables) optimized for reporting.
